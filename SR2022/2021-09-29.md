- Jake Howard
- Jenny Fletcher
- Karina Kwiatek
- Will Barber

## Minutes

- Kickstart
  - Should we _try_ and get a venue before announcing a kickstart date?
    - This may push back kickstart back a lot
    - We have sponsors now, does that increase our venue budget?
    - Single day competition, with a single (part) day setup beforehand?
      - This increases our options
  - Is 20 teams a reasonable number?
    - We already have this many teams with kits intending to compete
  - Kits
    - Kit team _may_ be able to get kits ready for ~4 weeks time
  - Term dates
    - ~25th October is half-term
  - 6th Nov could be viable, although the Friday is bonfire night
  - 13th is probably best, so we have more time for prep (game design usually takes a while)
- The Game
  - There’s a meeting in the calendar to discuss this
  - We’ll need a lot of meetings
- Budget / Scheduling
  - Approach possible venues as a sponsorship opportunity
    - There’s definitely some overlap between approaching sponsors and approaching venues, especially this year
- Competition announcement email
  - We should still open signups, but prioritize places to those who have kits
  - Pending sign-off from kit-team RE kickstart date

## Action Points

- Jake to create teams sign up form
- Andy-B-S to poke Andy Busse on the email to teams
- Andy-B-S and Jenny to look into possible venues (based on list from last year + potential sponsors)
