We used easyretro.io to run this retro. We took 10 minutes to write up our own
notes before sharing them (see "Raw comments" below), then had discussion on
retrospective topics we felt warranted it.

## Topics

### Building on the learnings of previous years

- At what point should we review retros?

  - Immediately before the next event
  - Shortly after the event to make sure we’ve captured and actioned things
  - All at once upon starting a competition year?

- How do we make sure the actions are carried forward?

  - Tasks repo?
  - Recurring tasks?

- We don’t have a “kickstart kickoff”, so there’s no notable start to the planning process, where reviewing this would be best done

- We don’t have anyone with “project management” experience, so we attempt it all ourselves

  - Our stack can be off putting

#### Actions

- Peter: Start further discussions on this (maybe in the all committees meeting, though it doesn’t need to be limited)

### Presentation rehearsal

- We should
- There’s a difference been rehearsals and preparation
- Could we pre-record them? (excluding questions)
- We should ensure rehearsals are done
  - And allocate (and protect) the time for them
- “What makes the ideal livestream?”
  - Different to just scenes
- Planning ahead of time is good
- Generalise the list of tasks we wrote for[SR2021 league session](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/competition/virtual-competitions/competition-session-checklist/) to be more widely useful (or create multiple)

#### Actions

- Jake: Create better documentation about how to run a livestream, likely
  extracted from the league session docs
- Peter: Start a discussion with the marketing team about livestreams and best
  practises; their input would be valuable here, is this an area it makes sense
  for them to own?

### Kit knowledge sharing

- A session was done a few months ago
- Hasn’t held anything back quite yet, but could do in future in the event of kit debugging
- Running an additional session would be useful
  - Not urgent
- The runbook does[document](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/kit/software/) all the components and link to the relevant documentation

### Producer

- We should have one
  - Jake: Add to documentation on running a livestream

### Disclaimer forms

- We didn’t give them to teams until very late
- Communication on how strict the shipping deadline is

#### Actions

- Dan: Add to agenda for discussion on next KT meeting

### More visual microgames

- Microgames were quite “wall of text”-y
- Make the microgames more engaging
- Actually gamify them
- Is this a function of it being virtual?
- More time would likely have given us higher quality
- Do we know the success rate is?
- We do see teams in physical competitions taking

#### Actions

- Andy BS: See what lessons we can learn from this year’s responses

### Earlier kit packing / prep weekend

- We still got a lot done in the weekend we did
- Little was done at the end of last year to prepare for this one
- Root cause likely a function of time constraints
- Intending to do this planning

#### Actions

- Jake: A doing around improving kit maintenance docs

### Meeting feedback

- It might have been better to have had a clearer focus for this this retro on
  the Kickstart event and separating out a more general retro for the longer
  term planning. As it was, we talked about both aspects yet were missing many
  volunteers who have contributed to the topics.
- Nominate a person to run the retro in advance (so they can plan the scope, setup the tool, etc.)
- It could be useful to have a mechanism to collect topics during the event
