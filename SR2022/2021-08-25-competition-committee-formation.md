## Brief Agenda:
* Dates
* Format of competition

## Notes:

* Bank balance:
    * Roughly *censored* GBP
    * Not enough to run a physical competition.
    * Aim to not spend more than half.
* Feasibility of shipping kits to teams:
    * Shipping - could be covered by teams.
* Current state of kits:
    * In teams hands
    * Not sure what the state is
    * Maybe leave kits in some teams hands if they recompete?
    * This is the kit team’s remit
        * Maybe their first priority is to get the kits back.
    * Potential to get some raspberry pi’s
    * TL;DR: kit is potentially usable, pending kit team discussion.
* Dates:
    * Schools start w/c 1st August
    * Normally we start Late Oct/Early Nov
    * Maybe aim for a post-half-term Kickstart.
        * (Half term: Monday 25 October to Friday 29 October 2021).
* Teams:
    * School trip for Kickstart?
        * Potentially more paperwork for this, but is plausible.
        * Not sure if teams will be enthusiastic.
    * International teams?
        * Unlikely for a physical competition finals.
    * Changes over time
        * No expertise from last year’s competition.
        * Teachers might need more hand-holding.
    * 
* Willingness to run a physical thing:
    * Tech days at team locations?
    * It’s easier to engage with people with a virtual competition.
    * However, not visiting teams loses a **lot **of the engagement and interactions.
    * Maybe produce a training pack?
    * Run mini-competitions and compare ranks to find winners?
    * We probably should not aim for a physical final competition
    * How [Pi Wars]( https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/) does it:
        * Regular check-ins
        * Team performs challenges at home and submits videos
        * Potentially a physical final.
    * Could we do the same as Pi Wars?
        * How to stop cheating?
            * We can design the game around it.
        * Concerns over having different challenges, doesn’t build up to a big thing?
            * We can design the game around it.
        * Pi wars has more funding, lets not copy them exactly.
* Funding:
    * Southampton may be a source?
        * Action Item: andy b-s - speak to joyce.
    * Maybe a free Venue?
        * There are costs for lighting & sound
* What is our aim
    * Is it okay to run a smaller number of teams?
    * Goals from funding application:
        * Motivate engineers to spread expertise.
        * Raise diversity awareness.
        * Interact with under-represented groups.
* Volunteers
    * ~15 replied to the sign up form from the trustees
    * Recruiting more:
        * Teams are a great source of volunteers, we never get many though
        * How to reach teams before we lose them?
        * Universities:
            * We have ~some people in Southampton
        * Speak to companies near teams to see if they can volunteer someone?
            * Also a way of getting funding maybe!
        * Apprenticeships?
        * [Linkedin volunteer marketplace](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/46688/the-linkedin-volunteer-marketplace-overview?lang=en)?
        * 
* In person social meeting:
    * Blended social/physical meeting to encourage people to come.
* Communicating to teams:
    * We should announce “we’re going to do something” in the first week.
