## Topics

### Friendlies this weekend

- Only two entrants so far, are they worth running?
- Can we defer the decision until Friday? Yes, let’s do this.
- What’s the minimal effort thing we can do which is still useful to those teams?
  - Probably just run their match (both ways around, so there’s two matches) & post them in the stream
- Let’s remind teams this evening (happened)
  - Discord only should be fine, especially as many teams could well have broken up for Easter already

### Volunteers social competition

- We have three(ish) entrants
- Should we set a date?
  - Before the next league, ideally before the last set of friendlies before that league, so we can fix things if needed
  - 17th April
  - Code submission deadline the same as the competitors
    - Use the code submitter
    - Need to ensure the TLAs don’t conflict with real teams
