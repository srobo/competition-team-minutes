## Topics

### Friendlies

- How few teams is too few?
  - 2, probably
  - If we minimize the time investment, we can run with very few teams
  - Below about 4 teams it’s probably not worth going for a full livestream
- We should still jump on a call internally, so we can use it as a testing opportunity
- Who’s doing what
  - This depends on the scale, as to the number of jobs needed
- Video scheduler
  - We should, if only for testing
- How can we encourage more teams to attend?
  - Should we have a prize for each session?
    - Probably not, undermines the friendliness of the friendlies
    - Could we do a raffle instead?
      - Gambling laws exist
    - We’re probably too late in the friendlies to implement this now
  - Are there alternative ways to incentivize attendance instead?
    - How?

### Mentoring

- We’ve not had any responses from volunteers
- Some of the competition team are available and willing
- We should reach out to all teams, not just the ones who didn’t attend module 1
- We’ve had 1 team request it so far
- There’s chance the team leaders aren’t aware teams are struggling
- We should ask all teams “how’s it going”, to gauge responsiveness

### Module 3

- We need to make a decision soon
- There are 2 more modules left to design
- There won’t be a change after the final league session (so the final league and knockouts are the same game)

## Action points

- Peter: Announce in teams’ channels about mentoring, and how to register interest
- Andy BS: Create a house robot to share for module 2

## Post-meeting _doing_

- Module 3 idea triaging
