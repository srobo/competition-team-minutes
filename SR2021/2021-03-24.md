## Topics

### Friendlies dates

- We should tell the teams about them

- What might friendlies look like?

  - The usual
  - Automatic stitch together videos and publish
  - Call for submissions in discord, and run rounds

- 3rd and 17th

  - Regular livestream format

- Postpone discussions for weekday friendlies to closer to the time

### MAI’s additional team

- We want to understand what the situation is here.

  - Is it new people getting involved, or is it a split of the current team

- It’s important to ensure that the competition remains fair. For example, it wouldn’t be fair to allow a team to submit multiple robots in order to test several strategies.

- If we were to allow this, we would want the second team really to be a different team

  - Sufficiently different codebase, ideally from scratch
  - Separate competitors
