# Competition Team Meeting 2020-12-03

## Present

* Andrew Barrett-Sprot
* Alistair Lynn
* Jake Howard
* James Seden Smith
* Will Barber

### Apologies

* Peter Law

## Topics

### Simulator

* Timesteps of 8 produce smaller videos (as opposed to 16)
  * Should we release with a lower timestep?
    * If so, before the first league?
      * Yes.
* There’s no noise on the radar distance sensors
  * We can add it later

### Tensorflow

* We don’t want it:
  * Hard to install
  * Big
  * Pain to use
  * Possibly not performant
  * May behave differently on different platforms
  * Pytorch & Scikit learn instead?

### Other libraries for simulator

* Numpy
* Scipy
* Scikit learn
* Pandas
* Pytorch for deep learning.
* Maybe Pillow with raw pixel data?
  * Add if there’s a team that wants ‘vision’

###  Tech Days

* We shouldn’t just assume we should host a ‘tech day’ just because its what we’ve done before
* What are our aims:
  * Hoist up the lower teams
  * Scare the medium teams to actually do something
* Hoist the lower teams:
  * Consensus: there’s no real need to have a single ‘event’, we can help them more on a rolling basis.
  * We should chase teams we haven’t heard from?
* Scare the medium teams:
  * Date for code submission (use tool).
  * Record matches and upload them for all to see (to scare teams).
  * Send logs to individual teams.

### Chasing up teams

* 1 Email to all teams:
  * Give them a checklist of things they should have done.
  * Chase up all teams to see how they’re going on:
    * If they finished the microgames
    * How is their robot doing
  * Chase up discord teams which are empty/have no leader.
    * No leader in discord possibly more concerning?
      * We could get Scarzy to email them
* Chase up teams which are ‘one team’ to tell them to split up. (separate email)
* Australia team:
  * Check up with them on how they’re doing given time zone differences, do they meet at a time we can help with, etc..

### Socials

* Among us?
* Let’s schedule something on the 12th.

### SR(A)WN

* Dan Trickey has offered to sort it! (thanks Dan, Than)

## Actions

- James: write an email with a checklist of things teams should have done by now.
- James: write an email to chase up the discord teams with no leader.
- Jake: write an email to poke teams to split up.
