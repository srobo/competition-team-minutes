## Topics

### Kit Shipping

 * We now have the new batteries. We don’t know what the schedule for packing/dispatch is
 * This is with Rob at the moment, though Jake has some of the kits. Jake will soon hand those over to Diane for combination with the batteries and dispatching to teams
 * The delay has already caused a team to drop out

### Mentoring update

 * Andy will pair up teams to mentors this weekend, though we’re expecting that the first sessions will now happen in the new year

### Venue

#### Reading

 * We have a quote for booking we requested (2 day setup, 2 late evenings), for us booking without any other contacts at the Uni
 * We need to now:
   * follow up with Reading to clarify the quote -> Jake (done)
   * build a budget around this quote which accounts for the other things this changes (hiring of things, accommodation changes) -> Andy BS

#### Southampton

 * We now have a full list of the societies which have the Cube
   * There are four groups we need to contact
   * Andy is (still) owning this, James will help
 * There’s currently a booking for the Cube for the Friday before (SUSU club night), though we think that club nights may no longer be running? Not clear if this will be an issue
 * SUSU are being a little less responsive at the moment
 * The Cube _can_ be booked for lectures & exams, but there doesn’t seem to be anything booked and we’d hope that those would be booked by now
 * We believe we have a hold on all the rooms, so there shouldn’t be any possibility of new conflicting bookings appearing

### 2020 Tech Days

 * SRO for Southampton: we have had some responses, Jake is still owning this
 * London: was blocked on confirming dates, Peter is still owning this
 * Cambridge: no progress
 * Clarification and decision on the dates: let’s use the end-of-month weekends


## Action Points

 * Jake: follow up with Reading to clarify the quote (done)
