## Minutes

### Kit Shipping

 * No update. This is concerning.
 * We have [requested an update via Slack](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/CMQ49PXPG/p1575484554000300)
 * Is there an option to hire a van and delivery the kits ourselves?
   Obviously doesn’t solve for the team(s) in Germany, though they’ve said that
   they’re happy to use their own batteries.
 * We would like this to be sorted by this weekend.

### Venue

#### Reading

 * Is looking very promising, see updates in #competition-venue
 * Jake’s put together an email to our contact outlining exactly what we have in mind and to progress to getting a formal quote.
 * Our contact will be sending over their floorplans digitally at some point for us (we already have paper ones from the visit)
 * We should use the floorplans to check we can fit all the pits in
 * Nothing yet from R U Hacking
 * Email to the education society will be going out this evening

#### Southampton

 * Andy BS posted in Slack:
   * He’s emailed Southampton to see if we can pay for someone to open SUSU on the weekend
   * No progress on contacting societies about moving bookings

### Future tech days

#### Cambridge

 * Haven’t asked about the Uni, they’re busy at the moment
 * Both the CompSci and Engineering departments are worth asking
 * Haven’t heard anything back regarding the Raspberry Pi foundation
 * Alternatively maybe Hills’ Road or someone in the Cambridge Business Park
